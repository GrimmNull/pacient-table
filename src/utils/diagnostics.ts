    "Paranoid schizophrenia": "The schizophrenic disorders are characterized in general by fundamental and characteristic distortions of thinking and perception, and affects that are inappropriate or blunted. Clear consciousness and intellectual capacity are usually maintained, although certain cognitive deficits may evolve in the course of time. The most important psychopathological phenomena include thought echo; thought insertion or withdrawal; thought broadcasting; delusional perception and delusions of control; influence or passivity; hallucinatory voices commenting or discussing the patient in the third person; thought disorders; and negative symptoms. The course of schizophrenic disorders can be either continuous, or episodic with progressive or stable deficit, or there can be one or more episodes with complete or incomplete remission. The diagnosis of schizophrenia should not be made in the presence of extensive depressive or manic symptoms unless it is clear that schizophrenic symptoms antedate the affective disturbance. Nor should schizophrenia be diagnosed in the presence of overt brain disease or during states of drug intoxication or withdrawal.\n <br />" +

The mood is shallow and inappropriate, thought is disorganized, and speech is incoherent. There is a tendency to social isolation. Usually the prognosis is poor because of the rapid development of ‘negative’ symptoms, particularly flattening of affect and loss of volition.

    "Depressive disorder": "Depressive episode\n<br />In typical mild, moderate or severe depressive episodes, the patient suffers from lowering of mood, reduction of energy and decrease in activity. Capacity for enjoyment, interest and concentration is reduced, and marked tiredness after even minimum effort is common. Sleep is usually disturbed and appetite diminished. Self Esteem and self-confidence are almost always reduced and, even in the mild form, some ideas of guilt or worthlessness are often present. The lowered mood varies little from day to day, is unresponsive to circumstances and may be accompanied by so-called ‘somatic symptoms, such as loss of interest and pleasurable feelings, waking in the morning several hours before the usual time, depression worst in the morning, marked psychomotor retardation, agitation, loss of appetite, weight loss, and loss of libido. Depending upon the number and severity of the symptoms, a depressive episode may be specified as mild, moderate or severe.\n<br />Mild depressive episode\nTwo or three of the above symptoms are usually present. The patient is usually distressed by these but will probably be able to continue with most activities.\n<br />Moderate depressive episode\nFour or more of the above symptoms are usually present and the patient is likely to have great difficulty in continuing with ordinary activities.\n<br />Severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms\nAn episode of depression in which several of the above symptoms are marked and distressing, typically loss of self-esteem and ideas of worthlessness or guilt. Suicidal thoughts and acts are common and a number of ‘somatic’ symptoms are usually present.\nAgitated depression\nMajor depression                                                single episode without psychotic symptoms\nVital depression\n<br />Severe depressive episode with psychotic symptoms\nAn episode of depression as described in severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms, but with the presence of hallucinations, delusions, psychomotor retardation or stupor so severe that ordinary social activities are impossible; there may be danger to life from suicide, dehydration or starvation.

There may, however, be brief episodes of mild mood elevation and overactivity (hypomania) immediately after a depressive episode, sometimes precipitated by antidepressant treatment. The more severe forms of recurrent depressive disorder (recurrent depressive disorder, current episode severe without psychotic symptoms and recurrent depressive disorder, current episode severe with psychotic symptoms) have much in common with earlier concepts such as manic-depressive depression, melancholia, vital depression and endogenous depression. The first episode may occur at any age from childhood to old age, the onset may be either acute or insidious, and the duration varies from a few weeks to many months. The risk that a patient with recurrent depressive disorder will have an episode of mania never disappears completely, however many depressive episodes have been experienced.

    "Anxiety": "Anxiety disorders\n<br />Phobic anxiety disorders\nA group of disorders in which anxiety is evoked only, or predominantly, in certain well-defined situations that are not currently dangerous. As a result, these situations are characteristically avoided or endured with dread. The patient’s concern may be focused on individual symptoms like palpitations or feeling faint and is often associated with secondary fears of dying, losing control, or going mad. Contemplating entry to the phobic situation usually generates anticipatory anxiety. Phobic anxiety and depression often coexist. Whether two diagnoses, phobic anxiety and depressive episode, are needed, or only one, is determined by the time course of the two conditions and by therapeutic considerations at the time of consultation.\n<br />Agoraphobia\nA fairly well-defined cluster of phobias embracing fears of leaving home, entering shops, crowds and public places, or travelling alone in trains, buses or planes. Panic disorder is a frequent feature of both present and past episodes. Depressive and obsessional symptoms and social phobias are also commonly present as subsidiary features. Avoidance of the phobic situation is often prominent, and some agoraphobics experience little anxiety because they are able to avoid their phobic situations. \n<br />Social phobias\nFear of scrutiny by other people, leading to avoidance of social situations. More pervasive social phobias are usually associated with low self-esteem and fear of criticism. They may present as a complaint of blushing, hand tremor, nausea or urgency of micturition, the patient sometimes being convinced that one of these secondary manifestations of their anxiety is the primary problem. Symptoms may progress to panic attacks.\n<br />Specific (isolated) phobias\nPhobias restricted to highly specific situations such as proximity to particular animals, heights, thunder, darkness, flying, closed spaces, urinating or defecating in public toilets, eating certain foods, dentistry or the sight of blood or injury. Though the triggering situation is discrete, contact with it can evoke panic as in agoraphobia or social phobia.\nAcrophobia\nAnimal phobias\nClaustrophobia\nSimple phobia\n<br />Other phobic anxiety disorders\n<br />Phobic anxiety disorder, unspecified\nPhobia NOS\nPhobic state NOS\n<br />\f\nOther anxiety disorders\nDisorders in which manifestation of anxiety is the major symptom and is not restricted to any particular environmental situation. Depressive and obsessional symptoms, and even some elements of phobic anxiety, may also be present, provided that they are clearly secondary or less severe.\n<br />Panic disorder [episodic paroxysmal anxiety]\nThe essential feature is recurrent attacks of severe anxiety (panic), which are not restricted to any particular situation or set of circumstances and are therefore unpredictable. As with other anxiety disorders, the dominant symptoms include sudden onset of palpitations, chest pain, choking sensations, dizziness and feelings of unreality (depersonalization or derealization). There is often also a secondary fear of dying, losing control or going mad. Panic disorder should not be given as the main diagnosis if the patient has a depressive disorder at the time the attacks start; in these circumstances, the panic attacks are probably secondary to depression.\nPanic:\n• attack\n• state\n<br />Generalized anxiety disorder\nAnxiety that is generalized and persistent but not restricted to, or even strongly predominating in, any particular environmental circumstances (i.e. it is ‘freefloating’). The dominant symptoms are variable but include complaints of persistent nervousness, trembling, muscular tensions, sweating, lightheadedness, palpitations, dizziness and epigastric discomfort. Fears that the patient or a relative will shortly become ill or have an accident are often expressed.\nAnxiety:\n• neurosis\n• reaction\n• state\n<br />Mixed anxiety and depressive disorder\nThis category should be used when symptoms of anxiety and depression are both present, but neither is clearly predominant, and neither type of symptom is present to the extent that justifies a diagnosis if considered separately. When both anxiety and depressive symptoms are present and severe enough to justify individual diagnoses, both diagnoses should be recorded and this category should not be used. \nAnxiety depression (mild or not persistent)\n<br />Other mixed anxiety disorders\nSymptoms of anxiety mixed with features of other disorders in obsessive-compulsive disorder – other neurotic disorders. Neither type of symptom is severe enough to justify a diagnosis if considered separately.\n<br />Other specified anxiety disorders\nAnxiety hysteria\nAnxiety disorder, unspecified\nAnxiety NOS\n<br />Obsessive-compulsive disorder\nThe essential feature is recurrent obsessional thoughts or compulsive acts. Obsessional thoughts are ideas, images or impulses that enter the patient’s mind again and again in a stereotyped form. They are almost invariably distressing and the patient often tries, unsuccessfully, to resist them. They are, however, recognized as his or her own thoughts, even though they are involuntary and often repugnant. Compulsive acts or rituals are stereotyped behaviours that are repeated again and again. They are not inherently enjoyable, nor do they result in the completion of inherently useful tasks. Their function is to prevent some objectively unlikely event, often involving harm to, or caused by, the patient, which he or she fears might otherwise occur. Usually, this behaviour is recognized by the patient as pointless or ineffectual and repeated attempts are made to resist. Anxiety is almost invariably present. If compulsive acts are resisted, the anxiety gets worse.\n<br />",
